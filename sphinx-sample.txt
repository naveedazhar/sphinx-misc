Sphinx is a popular documentation generator tool used to create documentation for Python projects. It allows you to write documentation in reStructuredText or Markdown and generate professional-looking documentation in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and more. Here are some basic examples to get you started with Sphinx:

1. Install Sphinx:

You can install Sphinx using pip:

bash

pip install sphinx

2. Create a Sphinx Documentation Project:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the documentation, and then run the following command to create a new Sphinx project:

bash

sphinx-quickstart

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your project. This will generate a conf.py configuration file and other necessary directories and files.

3. Writing Documentation:

Sphinx supports reStructuredText and Markdown for writing documentation. Create or edit .rst or .md files in the source directory to write your documentation content.

Example reStructuredText:

rst

.. your-doc-title
================

This is a section with some content.

Subsection
----------

This is a subsection.

.. code:: python

    def example_function():
        return "Hello, Sphinx!"

This is a reference to :func:`example_function`.

4. Build Documentation:

To generate the documentation, run the following command from the root directory of your Sphinx project:

bash

make html

This will create HTML documentation in the _build/html directory.

5. View Generated Documentation:

Open the generated HTML documentation in your web browser. You can find the main documentation file at _build/html/index.html.

6. Adding Cross-References:

Sphinx allows you to create links and cross-references to other parts of your documentation. Use the double colons :: to define a label and then reference it with a colon:

rst

:ref:`your-doc-title`  # Reference to the document title

7. Adding Images:

You can add images to your documentation using the .. image:: directive:

rst

.. image:: path/to/your/image.png
   :width: 300
   :height: 200

8. Adding Code Blocks:

Use the .. code:: directive to include code blocks:

rst

.. code:: python

    def example_function():
        return "Hello, Sphinx!"

9. Creating Lists and Tables:

You can create bullet lists, numbered lists, and tables in reStructuredText. Refer to the Sphinx documentation for detailed syntax.

10. Building Other Output Formats:

Besides HTML, Sphinx can generate various other output formats, including PDF, LaTeX, and ePub. You can use commands like make latex, make pdf, and make epub to build these formats.

This is just the beginning of what you can do with Sphinx. Sphinx is highly customizable, and you can configure your documentation to meet your specific needs, add custom styles, and integrate it with your Python projects for automatic API documentation generation. Be sure to refer to the official Sphinx documentation for more in-depth information and customization options: Sphinx Documentation.
